One day, without any alerts, a meteor shower reaches the ship, Arc that was working close to the cryogenic pods, but Arc, our hero, without any hesitation, drop his work and go on to find out whats going on. After he reaches the command center, he identified that a gas leak has occurred, killing everyone there. As the ship captain has died, he was the new commander for the crew. Knowing that, he start to look after the crew members that take care of the ship maintenance, after running there, he founds-out that this part of the ship still doesn't have been exposed to the leak, so he call on all the remaining members to go to the cryogenic pod. After guiding the remaining crew to there, they eject and watch their old ship been crushed by all the massive meteors in the shower.
- Without any navigation method, they've sent a rescue alert and Go into a deep cryogenic sleep. After traveling thousands of parsecs, waiting for their rescue, the pod detect something abnormally and wakes Arc up. But as he have been ages asleep, his body can't do much. For these reasons the humanity have developed a way to control the ship purely using their minds. And once he starts to use all incoming signals to discover where they are, he hears a horn that remind him about the really old coliseum matches.
- A cosmic vision explains to them whats going on, and informs to them that this is a match for ancients, the new galaxy citizens want to discover who are smarter and stronger, giving as prize the most desired thing in the world for the winners. For Arc, he just wants to go home and find her daughter, but how? And this is how he finds out, that the prize lives inside a worm hole.
